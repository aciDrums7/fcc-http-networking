Master the HTTP networking protocol by completing over 80 coding exercises and quizzes in JavaScript. Once you‚Äôve learned it all, we‚Äôll build a real web crawler using Node.js to put all the concepts into practice.

HTTP is the backbone of the modern web, and in this course we‚Äôll do a deep dive into all of the fundamentals you‚Äôll need to know to master web networking. We‚Äôll use the Fetch API to interact with a live RESTful server in order to connect the different components of a video game.
